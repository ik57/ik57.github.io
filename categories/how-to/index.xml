      <description>Net Sec Challenge Difficulty: Medium &amp;ldquo;Use this challenge to test your mastery of the skills you have acquired in the Network Security module. All the questions in this challenge can be solved using only nmap, telnet, and hydra.&amp;rdquo;
The first three questions can be answered by scanning all the ports between 1 to 65535 using nmap -p- flag. Or you could slice the scans to practice more nmap flags.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;This is a machine that allows you to practice web app hacking and privilege escalation&amp;rsquo;
TryHackMe -Basic Pentesting- is an easy room that only required knowing the basics. Primarily, the only tools you will need are:
Nmap gobuster Smbclient SSH Hydra John the Ripper Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to enumerate and exploit smb, it would be a good idea to do Network Services Room before you start the Basic Pentesting Room.</description>

      <description>Since bspwm doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle any keyboard input we need to use a third party program such as, sxhkd or polybar to switch between keyboard layouts.
1. Create a script First we need to create a script to switch between languages. Here is an example for a bash script that switch between English and Arabic:
#!/bin/bash # Switching between keyboard layouts CURRENT_LAYOUT=$(setxkbmap -query | awk &amp;#39;NR==3{print $2}&amp;#39;) if [ &amp;#34;$CURRENT_LAYOUT&amp;#34; = &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; ]; then # To switch to arabic setxkbmap &amp;#34;ara&amp;#34; else setxkbmap &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; fi Then, make the script executable using chmod +x command.</description>
