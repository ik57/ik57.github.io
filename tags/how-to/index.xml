      <description>&amp;lsquo;This is a machine that allows you to practice web app hacking and privilege escalation&amp;rsquo;
TryHackMe -Basic Pentesting- is an easy room that only required knowing the basics. Primarily, the only tools you will need are:
Nmap gobuster Smbclient SSH Hydra John the Ripper Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to enumerate and exploit smb, it would be a good idea to do Network Services Room before you start the Basic Pentesting Room.</description>

      <description>Since bspwm doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle any keyboard input we need to use a third party program such as, sxhkd or polybar to switch between keyboard layouts.
1. Create a script First we need to create a script that switch between languages. Here is an example for a bash script that switch between English and Arabic:
#!/bin/bash # Switching between keyboard layouts CURRENT_LAYOUT=$(setxkbmap -query | awk &amp;#39;NR==3{print $2}&amp;#39;) if [ &amp;#34;$CURRENT_LAYOUT&amp;#34; = &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; ]; then # To switch to arabic setxkbmap &amp;#34;ar&amp;#34; else setxkbmap &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; fi Then, make the script executable using chmod +x command.</description>
